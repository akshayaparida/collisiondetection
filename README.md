# Learning JavaScript Canvas Animation with Balls and Evil Circle

## Overview

This repository contains a JavaScript canvas animation project that I developed to enhance my skills in JavaScript programming and canvas animation techniques. Through this project, I acquired valuable insights and expertise in various aspects of JavaScript development and canvas manipulation.

## What I Learned

### JavaScript Programming

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Through the creation of classes such as `Shape`, `Ball`, and `EvilCircle`, I gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming concepts, including inheritance and encapsulation.
- **Event Handling:** By implementing event listeners for arrow key presses, I learned how to handle user input effectively, enabling interactive control over the movement of the evil circle within the canvas.
- **Algorithmic Thinking:** Developing collision detection algorithms allowed me to hone my algorithmic thinking skills, enabling me to efficiently detect and respond to collisions between objects (balls and evil circle).
- **Debugging and Optimization:** Throughout the project, I encountered and addressed various bugs and performance issues, enhancing my ability to debug and optimize JavaScript code for improved efficiency and functionality.

### Canvas Manipulation

- **Drawing and Rendering Graphics:** Utilizing the HTML `<canvas>` element and the CanvasRenderingContext2D API, I learned how to draw and render complex graphics, including circles (balls) and paths (evil circle), on the canvas dynamically.
- **Animation Techniques:** Implementing animation loops and update functions enabled me to create dynamic and visually engaging animations, enhancing my proficiency in canvas animation techniques.
- **Efficient Resource Management:** By optimizing the code for performance, including minimizing redundant calculations and efficiently managing resources, I improved the efficiency and responsiveness of the canvas animation.

## Next Steps

- **Advanced Animation Techniques:** I plan to explore more advanced canvas animation techniques, such as particle systems, physics-based animations, and advanced collision detection algorithms, to further enhance my skills and creativity in canvas animation.
- **Code Refactoring and Documentation:** Refactoring the code to improve readability, maintainability, and extensibility, while documenting key concepts and techniques learned, will be a priority to ensure that the project remains well-organized and accessible.
- **Project Expansion:** I intend to expand the project by adding new features, experimenting with different visual effects and interactions, and integrating additional JavaScript libraries and APIs, to continue pushing the boundaries of canvas animation.
